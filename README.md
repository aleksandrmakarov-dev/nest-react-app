# Medium clone website

To begin with, client side development is a part of full stack web development that deals with presentation of website or application. I decided to use React as front-end library as I was familiar with it and it gives you ability to building modern and functional web applications.

As for the server side I chose NestJS as this framework has modular system that helps to divide your application into parts and use Dependency Injection to link them. Also I decided to take PostgreSQL as database storage and Google Storage to storing files.
